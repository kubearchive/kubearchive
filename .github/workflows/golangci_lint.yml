          title-template: GolangCI Linting found errors
          body-template: |
            The scheduled workflow of GolangCI Lint found some problems. We run this scheduled
            against the whole codebase, so when a PR is submitted authors do not need to deal with
            problems they did not introduce. However we need to solve those problems from time to time.
            The URL of the failed job is:

            https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/actions/runs/{{ runId }}

            Run `golanci-lint` to see the errors locally, visit the worfklow run, make sure the problems
            you found locally match. Investigate if they do not match. Solve the problems and open a
            pull request to solve them.
