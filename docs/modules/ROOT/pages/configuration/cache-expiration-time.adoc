= Cache Expiration Time

KubeArchive delegates authentication and authorization to Kubernetes. To
avoid pressure on the Kubernetes API, KubeArchive caches the authentication
and authorization answers.

There are two different environment variables that control cache expiration:

* `CACHE_EXPIRATION_AUTHORIZED`: controls the expiration time for authorized/authenticated requests.
    If not set, the default value is **10 minutes**.
* `CACHE_EXPIRATION_UNAUTHORIZED`: controls the expiration time for unauthorized/unauthenticated requests.
    If not set, the default value is **1 minute**.

To modify the expiration time, perform the following steps:

. Edit or patch the `kubearchive-api-server` Deployment present on the `kubearchive`
namespace. The values need to be parseable by
link:https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration[time.ParseDuration]):
+
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: v1

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kubearchive-api-server
        env:
        - name: CACHE_EXPIRATION_AUTHORIZED
          value: 1h
        - name: CACHE_EXPIRATION_UNAUTHORIZED
          value: 5m

[WARNING]
====
If the values are not set, or they are not parseable by
link:https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration[time.ParseDuration],
the Deployment fails and does not start.
====

. Save the patch somewhere in the disk and apply it:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl patch -n kubearchive deployment kubearchive-api-server --patch-file path/to/patch.yaml

[IMPORTANT]
.Expiring the cache
====
To expire the current cache, restart the `kubearchive-api-server` deployment with
the command
[command]`kubectl rollout -n kubearchive restart deployment kubearchive-api-server`.
