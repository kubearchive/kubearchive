= Delayed Deletes

This document describes how to configure KubeArchive when resources need
to be deleted after a certain time.

KubeArchive features vacuums that rescan namespaces for stale or missed
resources. Vacuums in combination with filters that include time expressions
allow users to delay the deletion of resources. More information about Vacuums
xref:/reference/vacuum.adoc[here].

This feature is useful for resources that are monitored or modified by other
systems without any flag on the resource itself that can be used by KubeArchive.
For example metadata collection systems or build signature systems.

== KubeArchiveConfig
The following `KubeArchiveConfig` resource configures KubeArchive to delete
`Pod` ten seconds after they started if their `status.phase` is `Succeeded`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubearchive.org/v1
kind: KubeArchiveConfig
metadata:
  name: kubearchive
spec:
  resources:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
      deleteWhen: status.phase == "Succeeded" && timestamp(status.startTime) < now() - duration("10s")
----

Given a `Pod` that just prints `Hello`, when the latest update for it is received
by KubeArchive it is likely that the condition for deletion does not yet evaluate
to true.

== Vacuum
Create the following `NamespaceVacuumConfig` to configure the vacuum to scan all
resources configured for the namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubearchive.org/v1
kind: NamespaceVacuumConfig
metadata:
  name: all
spec:
    resources: []
----

This won't trigger anything by itself, you need something that runs the actual vacuum
process.

== CronJob
The following `CronJob` executes the vacuum process for the vacuum configuration
created in the previous section:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: all-vacuum
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"  # Execute each minute
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          serviceAccount: kubearchive-vacuum
          containers:
            - name: vacuum
              image: quay.io/kubearchive/vacuum:<your KubeArchive version>
              command: [ "/ko-app/vacuum" ]
              args:
                - --config
                - all  # name of the NamespaceVacuumConfig
              env:
                - name: NAMESPACE
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                     fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          restartPolicy: Never
----

Each time this `CronJob` executes KubeArchive receives the resources
configured in the `NamespaceVacuumConfig` (in this case all resources
in the `KubeArchiveConfig`) so they are processed again.

== Configuring Cluster-wide Delayed Deletes
To configure a single vacuum to scan all the namespaces for all the
resources use a `ClusterVacuumConfig` within the installation
namespace of KubeArchive (by default `kubearchive`):

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubearchive.org/v1
kind: ClusterVacuumConfig
metadata:
  name: vacuum-config-all
  namespace: kubearchive
spec:
  namespaces: {}
----

And then create a `CronJob` in the same namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: vacuum-all
  namespace: kubearchive
spec:
  schedule: "* */1 * * *"  # Execute the first minute of each hour
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          serviceAccount: kubearchive-cluster-vacuum
          containers:
            - name: vacuum
              image: quay.io/kubearchive/vacuum:<your KubeArchive version>
              command: [ "/ko-app/vacuum" ]
              args:
                - --type
                - cluster
                - --config
                - vacuum-config-all  # name of the ClusterVacuumConfig
              env:
                - name: KUBEARCHIVE_NAMESPACE
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                     fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          restartPolicy: Never
