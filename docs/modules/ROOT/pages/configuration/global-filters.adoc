= Configuring Global Filters on KubeArchive

KubeArchive allows cluster owners to configure global filters. These are applied
to any KubeArchive namespace containing a `KubeArchiveConfig` custom resource.

To configure the global filters create a `ClusterKubeArchiveConfig` custom resource.
Only one `ClusterKubeArchiveConfig` resource is allowed, and it must be named
"kubearchive".  When it is created namespace these filters are considered global:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: kubearchive.org/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterKubeArchiveConfig
metadata:
  name: kubearchive
spec:
  resources:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
      archiveOnDelete: "true"
----

== Interaction With Local Filters

Global filters only work in namespaces containing a `KubeArchiveConfig` custom
resource. These can be understood as "local" filters in opposition with global
filters. Both global and local filters are combined with an "OR" type of logic
and used for that specific namespace.

For example, the following `KubeArchiveConfig` in the namespace "my-team"
archives jobs as long as they have `status.startTime` and deletes them when they
have `status.completionTime`. However KubeArchive also archives pods when they are
about to be deleted, as configured in the global `ClusterKubeArchiveConfig` in
the previous section:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: kubearchive.org/v1alpha1
kind: KubeArchiveConfig
metadata:
  name: kubearchive
  namespace: my-team
spec:
  resources:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: batch/v1
        kind: Job
      archiveWhen: has(status.startTime)
      deleteWhen: has(status.completionTime)
----

For example the following `KubeArchiveConfig` in the namespace "production" KubeArchive
only archives pods when they are about to be deleted, as configured in the
global `ClusterKubeArchiveConfig` in the previous section:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: kubearchive.org/v1alpha1
kind: KubeArchiveConfig
metadata:
  name: kubearchive
  namespace: production
spec: {}
----

[NOTE]
====
All `ClusterKubeArchiveConfig` and `KubeArchiveConfig` resources must be named "kubearchive".
