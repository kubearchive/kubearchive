= Kronicler Logs

This page refers to the logs produced by Kronicler. To see how Kronicler
integrates with logging systems, check
xref:integrations/logging.adoc[].

== Environment variables

Kronicler supports the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL`, which is present
on all its Deployments with a value of `"INFO"` by default. This variable
specifies the minimum log level to be logged. To see debug logs, set it as
`"DEBUG"` and rollout the Deployment. For example:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl set -n kronicler env deployment kronicler-api-server LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
kubectl set -n kronicler env deployment kronicler-operator LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
kubectl set -n kronicler env deployment kronicler-sink LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
----

[INFO]
====
The rollout of the Deployments happens automatically after using the
command `kubectl set env`.
