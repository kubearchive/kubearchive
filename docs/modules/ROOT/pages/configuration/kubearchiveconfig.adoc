= Configuring KubeArchive to Monitor a Namespace

A user can configure KubeArchive to monitor a specific namespace by creating
a `KubeArchiveConfig` custom resource similar to the following:
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: kubearchive.org/v1
kind: KubeArchiveConfig
metadata:
  name: kubearchive
  namespace: ns
spec:
  resources:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Event
      archiveWhen: status.state != 'Completed'
      deleteWhen: status.state == 'Completed'
----

The `archiveWhen` and `deleteWhen` keys contain expressions that determine when resources of that kind are archived or deleted.

[NOTE]
====
The 'KubeArchiveConfig` resource must be named "kubearchive".
