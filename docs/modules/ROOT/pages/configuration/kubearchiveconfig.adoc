= Configuring KubeArchive to Monitor a Namespace

A user can configure KubeArchive to monitor a specific namespace using `ApiServerSource` by creating
a `KubeArchiveConfig` custom resource similar to the following:
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: kubearchive.org/v1alpha1
kind: KubeArchiveConfig
metadata:
  name: kubearchive
  namespace: ns
spec:
  resources:
    - selector:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Event
      archiveWhen: status.state != 'Completed'
      deleteWhen: status.state == 'Completed'
----
The configuration of `ApiServerSource` is done using the `selector` keys of the KubeArchiveConfig custom
resource. The format of the `selectors` key can be found in the `ApiServerSource`
link:https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sources/apiserversource/reference/#resources-parameter[reference documentation].

The `archiveWhen` and `deleteWhen` keys contain expressions that determine when resources of that kind are archived or deleted.

[NOTE]
====
The 'KubeArchiveConfig` resource must be named "kubearchive".
