= Observability on KubeArchive

KubeArchive emits observability data using OpenTelemetry: metrics, traces and
logs. Environment variables on KubeArchive's components control the enablement
and configuration of features related with observability.

## Custom Metrics

KubeArchive exposes the following custom metrics:

### kubearchive.cloudevents.total

**Labels**: `result`, `event_type` `resource_type`

Tracks the total number of Cloud Events (resource updates) received aggregated by `resource_type`,
`event_type` and `result`.

* `result`: one of `insert`, `update`, `none`, `error`, `no_match` or `no_conf`.
** `error`: there was an error during the processing of the resource update. This may indicate
    problems with the database, deleting resources, Cloud Event corruption, etc. Check the logs
    to find the root cause.
** `no_conf`: the resource update received is not configured on any `KubeArchiveConfig`. This may
    mean there is something sending Cloud Events to KubeArchive but it should not.
** `no_match`: the resource update received does not match the conditions for processing. This may
    indicate that KubeArchiveConfig rules should be refined.
** `insert`: the resource was inserted into the database.
** `update`: a resource with the same `metadata.uid` exists in the database and it was updated.
** `none`: a resource with the same `metadata.uid` exists in the database and its
    `metadata.managedFields.time` was newer, so there was no update. This may indicate a problem
    with the system that sends resource updates.

* `resource_type`: a combination of the resource `apiVersion` and `kind`. For example `apps/v1/Deployment`,
`v1/Pods` or `tekton.dev/v1/PipelineRun`.
* `event_type`: one of `dev.knative.apiserver.resource.new`, `dev.knative.apiserver.resource.update`
or `dev.knative.apiserver.resource.delete`.

## Configuring Observability

The following environment variables present on all of the KubeArchive components
and control the observability behavior:

* `KUBEARCHIVE_OTEL_MODE`: one of "enabled", "delegated" or "disabled". Defaults to
 "disabled". It controls when observability data is sent to `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`:
** "disabled": do not send traces or metrics.
** "enabled": always send traces and metrics. Useful for observability in development.
** "delegated": always send metrics but send traces only when the incoming request sent its traces (see
link:https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-2/#sampled-flag[W3 Trace Context `sampled` flag]).
Useful for observability in production.
* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: an OTLP compatible endpoint where traces are
    sent. By default it is set to an empty string.
* `KUBEARCHIVE_OTLP_SEND_LOGS`: if set to "true" logs are sent to the
    `OTEL_EXPOTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and not printed to stdout. Defaults to
    "false", so logs are printed on stdout by default. When enabled, a single log line
    is printed to stdout informing that logs will be redirected.

To change these environment variables values, edit or patch KubeArchive's
components: `deployments/kubearchive-api-server`, `deployments/kubearchive-sink`
and `deployments/kubearchive-operator`.
