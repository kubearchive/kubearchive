= Performance Profiling (pprof) Support

KubeArchive ships with
link:https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof[HTTP pprof endpoints]
enabled on all of its components. Each component exposes the endpoint
in its own port:

* Operator: `:8082/debug/pprof/`
* Sink: `:80/debug/pprof/`
* API: `:8081/debug/pprof/`

This feature is controlled by an environment variable called `KUBEARCHIVE_ENABLE_PPROF`.
By default it is set as `"true"` (lowercase "true" string), change it to any other value
to disable the pprof instrumentation.

See the
link:https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof[HTTP pprof documentation]
for usage examples.
