= Documentation Style

When contributing documentation to KubeArchive you are expected to follow
the guidelines listed below:

* Use present tense, instead of future or past.
* Use the active voice, instead of the passive voice.
* Use the second and third persons, instead of first person.
* Use positive phrases, instead of negative phrases.
* Use cautious language, instead of making claims.
* Do not recommend.
* Use english abbreviations, instead of latin abbreviations.

== Tense

Use present tense whenever possible:

NO: When configured in this way KubeArchive will delete resources.

YES: When configured in this way KubeArchive deletes resources.

== Voice

Use active voice as much as possible, as its usually more direct than the passive:

NO: This feature is configured in the ConfigMap.

YES: Configure this feature in the ConfigMap.

NO: Resources are deleted by KubeArchive when `deleteWhen` is configured.

YES: KubeArchive deletes resources when you configure `deleteWhen`.

== Persons

Avoid first person and use second to interact with the reader and third to describe
things:

NO: We create the following `KubeArchiveConfig` resource.

YES: Create the following `KubeArchiveConfig` resource.

NO: Execute the file we provide.

YES: Execute the file provided.

== Positive Phrases

Use positive phrases as negative ones are sometimes confusing, most notably when they
contain two negatives:

NO: Do not set the field when its value is redundant.

YES: Set the field if its value is different to avoid redundancy.

NO: If the feature is not configured KubeArchive does not delete resources.

YES: If the feature is configured KubeArchive deletes resources.

== Claims and Recommendations

Use a "cautious" language when talking about some topics as performance, benefits, best
practices or security:

NO: KubeArchive improves the performance of your Kubernetes cluster.

YES: KubeArchive can improve the performance of your Kubernetes cluster.

NO: It is recommended that you increase the number of API replicas when facing performance problems.

YES: When facing performance problems, increase the number of API replicas.

NO: The default value is set to X. We recommend Y.

YES: The default value is set to X. Increase it to Y to avoid occasional problems.

== Latin Abbreviations

Use the english abbreviations instead of their latin counterparts.

NO: Used to login with ko (e.g. "quay.io")

YES: Used to login with ko (for example "quay.io")

NO: These are style rules (syntax, indentation, naming, etc.)

YES: These are style rules (syntax, indentation, naming, and so on)

YES: These are style rules (syntax, indentation, naming, and other rules)

NO: against the body of the cloud event (that is the resource)
