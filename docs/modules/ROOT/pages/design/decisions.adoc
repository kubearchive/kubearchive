= Design Decisions

This document contains the design decisions we kept in a Google Doc before
moving to GitHub. They are slightly based on
link:https://medium.com/olzzio/y-statements-10eb07b5a177[Y-Statement] and
link:https://adr.github.io/[ADRs]. There are newer decisions that were not
written and stored and were added afterward, so dates are not accurate in
some cases.

== Disaster recovery feature
Date: 2024-02-20

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Sam Koved, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Hector Martinez

In the context of choosing if the project does backup and restore of Kubernetes
resources, we decided that the project will not perform restore of Kubernetes objects.
Doing backup and restore conveys the idea of using the project as a disaster recovery tool,
something we don't want to do. There are other tools, like https://velero.io/, that do
disaster recovery as their main goal.

== Name selection
Date: 2024-03-04

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Sam Koved, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Hector Martinez

In the context of choosing a name for the project, we decided to go with KubeArchive
because we did not have a better name. We accept that the name may evoke that the project
features restoration.

== Language selection
Date: 2024-03-07

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Sam Koved, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Hector Martinez

In the context of selecting a language to implement KubeArchive, there are multiple
options. We decided to use Go because it is widely used in the Kubernetes ecosystem, it
is lightweight, it is compiled, it is fast, and it has a big ecosystem from which we
can use multiple libraries if needed. We accept that there are other suitable alternatives
in which we have experience (Java or Python, for example), but have some downsides (bloating
in Java and the interpreter in Python).

== Repository structure
Date: 2024-03-21

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Hector Martinez, Sam Koved

Files live in the same repository by default, except cases where we decide otherwise.
A common package exists to share common objects and functions between the different
executables Kubearchive provides. The repository also includes the Helm charts for deployment.

== API technology selection: REST vs gRPC
Date: 2024-03-08

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Sam Koved, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Hector Martinez

In the context of providing an API to access database content, facing two options of
technology, REST and gRPC, we decided for REST to achieve a simpler, more decoupled API.
We accept that the performance is worse than the gRPC alternative.

A comparison between REST and gRPC can be found on this AWS page.

== REST API Framework
Date: 2024-04-18

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon Greg Allen M. Andrea Fernandez George Varsamis Chris Beer

As stated in a previous decision we are going with go for the REST API component of kubearchive.

We want to use a framework as it makes development, testing and readability easier.

The framework must provide:
* Good performance
* Not enforced ORM (using the ORM separated from the API framework gives us more flexibility in case
we want to try a different DB type in the future, like NoSQL MongoDB.
* Large community
* Support for middleware (we are going to need it for including the RBAC authorization)

There are several frameworks in Go, here are some articles stating pros and cons:
* link:https://medium.com/@stellarani.seeli/golang-frameworks-you-must-know-4023c35afb80[Gin, Beego, Fiber, Echo and GoFr]
* link:https://www.monocubed.com/blog/golang-web-frameworks/[Gin, Beego, Fiber, Echo, Revel, Buffalo, Chi and Gorilla]

Gin is the most popular one and complies with all the requirements so we are going with it.

== Separate writes from reads
Date: 2024-03-11

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Sam Koved, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Hector Martinez

We have two different operations to do against a database, read and write, and we have two
very different actors interacting with those systems, event system on write and user on read.
We agreed to have (two) separate components for those interactions. This will help with the
scalability on any interaction without compromising the other interaction. One thing we need
to keep in mind is that it's easier if those components share part of the code, as
deserialization of objects and similar code is shared.

== Using APIServerSource as the source of resource changes and not being an operator
Date: 2024-03-11

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Sam Koved, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Hector Martinez

In the context of deciding how KubeArchive should receive updates about resources changing,
there were two main options: be an operator and reconcile (read-only) resources or receive
updates from another resource monitor system. We decided to use a resource monitor system.
In our case, this is the APIServerSource from Knative Eventing (OpenShift Serverless),
which sends events from any subscribed resource to a sink. This removes the need to craft
our own code to get resource events, but it prevents us from fine-tuning in case it is needed.
At some point, we also can fork the APIServerSource for our own needs.

== Should KubeArchive delete the resources it archives?
Date: 2024-03-11

Status: Superseded 2024-04-08

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Sam Koved, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Fernando Nasser, George Varsamis

In the context of deciding if KubeArchive should delete resources it archives or not, we
agreed that KubeArchive should not delete resources it archives. The reasoning is that
KubeArchive would need knowledge about the domain to be able to determine when to delete
something. This information would be difficult to convey to users, so we agreed not to delete
the resources ourselves. We will archive resources, but the user is responsible for deleting them.

== KubeArchive should be able to delete resources it archives
Date: 2024-04-08, updated 2024-06-10

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Sam Koved, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Fernando Nasser, George Varsamis, Hector Martinez

Kubearchive deletes the resources it archives because it aligns with the purposes of
preventing performance issues. KubeArchive has a configuration option that allows users
to introduce conditions that will trigger the deletion of the resources. For example if
the "finished" status key is "true". Multiple conditions can be specified. This can be
configured per resource kind and apiVersion. No configuration means the resources are not deleted.

== Database
Date: 2024-04-04

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Greg Allen, Sam Koved, Marta Anon, George Varsamis

KubeArchive uses Postgresql for its database.

KubeArchive has a generic database layer, which should allow the details of the underlying
database to be hidden and allow for a different database to be substituted.
More information in KAR-6.

== Deployment/Templating System
Date: 2024-04-15

Status: Superseded

Reviewers: Greg Allen, Sam Koved, Marta Anon, George Varsamis

For the first approach in development KubeArchive uses Helm to deploy and manage
its Kubernetes resources. Kustomize may be used in addition to Helm if it makes sense.

== Use an operator for automating the deployment and configuration of KubeArchive
Date: 2024-04-09

Status: Superseeded

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Hector Martinez, Greg Allen,

Kubearchive uses an operator to manage its installation and configuration because they
are complex enough that Helm is not enough. The configuration is controlled by a custom resource.

== Development Environment
Date: 2024-04-04

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Greg Allen, Sam Koved, Marta Anon, George Varsamis

Kubearchive officially supports kind with podman as backend for development. Kubearchive
also provides VS Code and IntelliJ configuration. Contributors are not forced to use these
tools, these tools constitute our supported development environment.

== Feature “archive everything now”
Date: 2024-04-08

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Hector Martinez Lopez, Greg Allen

Having an element in kubearchive that enables sending a command to archive the monitored
resources without relying on the events sent by ApiServerSource would provide the following advantages:
* Archive in-place resources after kubearchive is deployed
* Fallback in case events are lost

== Documentation language
Date: 2024-04-08

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Hector Martinez, Chris Beer, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Fernando Nasser, George Varsamis

Kubearchive will use Asciidoc and Antora for its documentation because it is what we are used to as a team.

== Vision Statement
Date: 2024-03-11

Status: Writing

Reviewers: Marta Anon, Sam Koved, Greg Allen, Andrea Fernandez, Hector Martinez, George Varsamis, Fernando Nasser, Chris Beer

* Kubearchive has a one-way workflow. It stores resources from etcd in the DB but not the other way around.
* Kubearchive can prune resources from etcd once they are archived
* Kubearchive is integrated with etcd. When a user ask for a resource type he should see elements both in etcd and the archive DB.
* Kubearchive can retrieve the logs stored in a backend like splunk.

NOTE: “can” means that is configurable

== Cache of authorization requests in kubearchive API
Date: 2024-04-18

Status: Accepted

Reviewers:Marta Anon Greg Allen M. Andrea Fernandez George Varsamis Chris Beer, Hector Martinez

The queries to kubearchive are probably going to be repeated for the same type of object
from the same user/groups. This means that we could take advantage of caching the responses
of the `subjectaccessreviews` endpoint of the k8s API.

We will go with an in-memory caching. More information in KAR-4

== KubeArchive archiving is condition-based
Date: 2024-06-10

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta, Greg, Andrea, Fernando, Sam, Hector

KubeArchive has a configuration option that allows users to specify conditionals that will trigger
the archival of that resource in that specific state. For example if the status key "state" is
"Running". Multiple conditions for archival are allowed. No configuration provided means that
there is no archival of resources. This can be configured per resource kind and apiVersion.

== Cluster scope resources
Date: 2024-06-10

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta, Greg, Andrea, Fernando, Sam, Hector

In relation to the processing of cluster scope resources we decided not to process them. Currently
our use case is with namespaced resources and unless a strong case appears for cluster-scoped resources
its implementation is complex enough for us to reject processing them.

== Helm Chart Naming Conventions
Date: 2024-06-25

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta, Greg, Andrea, Fernando

For naming the resources in the kubearchive Helm Chart we defined the following conventions:
* A resource name won’t include the `Kind` of the resource in the name.
* A resource name won’t be hardcoded. All the names should be templated from the `Values.yaml`
* The resource name must include `kubearchive` as a prefix when it refers to a kubearchive
resource. We will use the built-in object `Release.Name`
* The templates will use the tpl function to reference a templated variable like “{{ Release.Name }}-<obj-name>

== KubeArchive Helm Chart namespace
Date: 2024-06-25

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta, Greg, Andrea, Fernando

The Helm Charts are another namespaced kubernetes resource.
We don’t want to install the kubearchive chart in the `default` namespace, not create a
specific namespace to allocate the chart, we want to use the `kubearchive` namespace to
allocate the helm chart.

For doing so, Helm provides an option in the install command (--create-namespace) that creates
a namespace in the first step and stores the chart inside.

== Usage of “required” function in the Helm templates
Date: 2024-06-25

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Marta, Greg, Andrea, Fernando

Helm provides a required function to prevent having optional values (like labels or namespaces)
empty after the `helm template` command.

This is very useful to catch typos and similar errors in the CI phase.

We will include them in the optional fields of the templates. The mandatory fields don’t need
t (like name) as they will be notified with `helm lint` command (also run in the CI).

== KubeArchive does not offer a database
Date: 2024-07-05

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Hector Martinez, Greg Allen, Sam Koved, Andrea Fernandez, Marta Anon

KubeArchive does not deploy a database in normal conditions. KubeArchive does not want
to manage or control the database of users. They need to provide their own database and
configure KubeArchive to connect to it.

Note: KubeArchive deploys a database for development purposes.

== Single APIServerSource vs Multiple APIServerSource
Date: 2024-09-02

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Hector Martinez, Greg Allen, Sam Koved, Andrea Fernandez

KubeArchive uses a single Knative API Server Source to get all the updates related to the
resources the KubeArchive user wants. We used a multiple Knative API Server Source approach,
but it involved deploying one instance per namespace, and that may lead to resource problems
and it makes the process more complex. Using a single instance consumes less resources is
simpler from the code point of view and it could be enough for our case. If performance is
limitant with a single APIServerSource we can review this decision and go with multiple
instances.

== KubeArchive deployment using Kubernetes manifests, generated by Kustomize
Date: 2025-01-01 (I can't recall the date)

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Hector Martinez, Greg Allen, Sam Koved, Andrea Fernandez, Marta Anon

After using Helm for a while we decided that the best way to reduce the complexity
to install KubeArchive is to switch to use Kubernetes manifests. We used Helm to generate
the Kubernetes Manifests for a while, but its template system made the files more complex
to read, so we switched to use Kustomize for the manifest generation.

== KubeArchive writes the Log URL on resource archival
Date: 2025-01-01 (I can't recall the date)

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Hector Martinez, Greg Allen, Sam Koved, Andrea Fernandez, Marta Anon

KubeArchive stores the Log URL when the resource associated is persisted. This ensures that the URL
continues to be valid regardless the change on the environment. For example if there is a new logging
system, but the old still exists, KubeArchive will return valid Log URLs for old entries. If KubeArchive
created the Log URLs upon read, all the old entries would have wrong URLs, forcing the migration
of the logs to a new system.

In the case users want to migrate old entries, they should rewrite the database entries themselves.

== KubeArchive offer patches for SQL migration
Date: 2025-01-27

Status: Accepted

Reviewers: Hector Martinez, Greg Allen, Sam Koved, Andrea Fernandez, Marta Anon

KubeArchive offers a series of SQL patches to migrate the database schema from one version
to the next. Additionally KubeArchive offers a single SQL file that should be used in new
installations. The implementation will be decided after inspection of the different tools available.
