== Overview

Kronicler requires a database to store resources.
This document list the databases supported, how to set up the database schema
and how to add new database integrations.

=== PostgreSQL

Currently, PostgreSQL is the only fully supported database engine.
The Kronicler integration test suite runs with the PostgreSQL version detailed in
link:{download-path}/kronicler.sql[the kronicler.sql file].

The PostgreSQL implementation is available
link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/postgresql.go[here].

The PostgreSQL schema is available
link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/integrations/database/postgresql/kronicler.sql[here]
and in the
link:{download-path}[release]
as [filename]`kronicler.sql`.

=== MariaDB

This integration is still in progress.

The MariaDB implementation is available
link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/mariadb.go[here].

== Configuration and Customization

=== Schema

Kronicler offers a [filename]`kronicler.sql` file with the instructions to set up
the schema as part of the installation process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The provided schema includes indexes.

Kronicler users should review and customize the indexes
if needed based on the expected queries and the amount and
distribution of the expected archived data.
====

The schema includes the creation of the database `kronicler` owned by the `kronicler` user.
The schema expects the existence of a `kronicler` database user fow owning this database.

[IMPORTANT]
====
An account with admin privileges should run [filename]`kronicler.sql`.

[source, bash]
----
psql -U admin \ <1>
-h database.example.com \ <2>
-f kronicler.sql
----
<1> The database admin account used to apply the schema. It can be different from the Kronicler DB user.
<2> The database URL
====

=== Database Credentials

The `kronicler-database-credentials` Secret stores the information to connect Kronicler with the Database.

The default content of this Secret when Kronicler is installed is:

[source, yaml]
----
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: kronicler-database-credentials
  namespace: kronicler
stringData:
  DATABASE_KIND: postgresql
  DATABASE_PORT: "5432"
  DATABASE_URL: "kronicler-rw.postgresql.svc.cluster.local"
  DATABASE_DB: "kronicler"
  DATABASE_USER: "kronicler"
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: "Databas3Passw0rd"  # notsecret
----

Update the secret with the specific values of your database and
restart the pods accordingly to pick the new values.
The command for changing the most common values, URL and password, is:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl patch secret -n kronicler kronicler-database-credentials \
--patch='{"stringData": {
"DATABASE_URL": "database.example.com", <1>
"DATABASE_PASSWORD": "password" <2>
}}'
----
<1> The database URL
<2> The database password

[WARNING]
====
If you change the `DATABASE_USER` or the `DATABASE_DB` then you should accordingly update
the schema provided within the Kronicler release.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Don't forget to restart kronicler sink and api as both access the database:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl rollout -n kronicler restart deployment kronicler-sink kronicler-api-server
----
====


== Adding a New Database

To add a new database integration follow the instructions:

1. Create a new file under `pkg/database` named after the new database engine.
2. Include an
link:https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#init[init function]
that:

* Inserts in the
link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/database.go#L27[`RegisteredDBCreators`]
map an entry keyed with the name of the DB type with a
link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/database.go#L24[`newDBCreatorFunc`]
implementation as value.

* Inserts in the
link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/database.go#L26[`RegisteredDatabases`]
map an entry keyed with the name of the DB type with a
link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/database.go#L23[`newDatabaseFunc`]
as value.

=== The `newDBCreatorFunc`

This function receives the set of environment variables with the database configuration and returns a
link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/facade/creator.go[`DBCreator`]
implementation.

The `DBCreator` should include `env` as a parameter so the `GetConnectionString` can access them.

=== The `DBInterface` implementation returned by the `newDatabaseFunc`

[NOTE]
====
This section includes the development guidelines expected by the Kronicler maintainers.
====

The `DBInterface` should be a struct with
link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/main/pkg/database/database.go#L40[`Database`]
embedded.

Make sure to implement the interfaces that are part of it:

* link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/facade/deleter.go[DBDeleter]
* link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/facade/filter.go[DBFilter]
* link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/facade/inserter.go[DBInserter]
* link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/facade/selector.go[DBSelector]
* link:https://github.com/kronicler/kronicler/blob/{page-component-display-version}/pkg/database/facade/sorter.go[DBSorter]

[NOTE]
====
All the interfaces work with objects from the
link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/huandu/go-sqlbuilder[sqlbuilder Go library].
Check out the docs to see how to work with them.
====

[TIP]
====
Some interfaces, like `DBDeleter`, have a default implementation.

Other interfaces, like `DBFilter`, have a partial implementation.

Those implementations may have the functionality that you need.
Check them before implementing your own.
====

If the database interaction logic changes from the implementation in the `Database` struct,
override the implementation of the affected functions.
For example, a database that does not support upsert queries
needs to implement `ResourceInserter` as a series of  `SELECT` and an `INSERT` statements.

Take a look at the current database integrations and
feel free to contribute to our code adding new database integrations!
